# Before install

To install the game, you must first have an IDE that can run Java code in terminal (Intellji, Eclipse and etc). You would also need to down JDK 18 or above on your device, as that is the minimal requirement to run the game.

# Install Instruction

First, you would need to go to the gitlab repo, as in the link below:

https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7341252/workshop-10-group-1/-/tree/main

In here, clone the repo into your own IDE:

After the repo is cloned, selected the file src/game/AdventureGame and run:

Then, you would be able to start the game in terminal.
