The game was inspired by the idea of simplicity while having an array of creative elements to work on as a team. It was more crucial to show our collaboration and the processes we learned for Software Engineering, thus we agreed on implementing a text-based java game.

Our meetings were accomplished through Teams since it was convenient. Any communication, either text or call was through Teams as well.

The first draft of the story was reviewed by all the members before being implemented, and multiple new rooms were added with new changes made through our development process. The first draft had 5 rooms and one enemy but 2 rooms were added, with many enemies in different rooms at the end of our process.
