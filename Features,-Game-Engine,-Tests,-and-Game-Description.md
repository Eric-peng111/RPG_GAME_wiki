For test cases, we`ve created detailed JUnit 4 tests for the project. They cover most of the methods in the project, and considers different potential situations that the user might encounter.

For Game Tester, in this project, we use a Gradle test CI auto game tester. Whenever a change is made to the project, the CI would automatically check the change can pass our tests. And if they don`t, we would be able to reject the merge in time.
